# Chapter 3: Install MetaMask

### The only thing you need to connect to the blockchain world is a wallet.

Installing a wallet will by default create a new account for you, which is unique, and is needed to transact on the blockchain. This account has a public address and a private key (basically a password) to sign transactions. Your account will allow you to buy and sell data, data assets, and services through the Ocean Protocol network.

Wallets come in many forms and flavors, but a popular option is MetaMask. A simple browser add-on (and mobile app). It is quick to install, but it takes some planning: now is the time to get prepared to write down, backup, and carefully save your **seed phrase** and password.

**That seed phrase should be kept secret and safe, it’s the unique key to your address.** There is no other way to access your wallet than with this seed phrase and password, so you have to be extra careful if you don't want to lose access.

MetaMask is available for Chrome, Firefox, Android, and iOS. Select the one you want to install (typically the one recommended by MetaMask); you will be redirected to the app/extensions store.

**Install MetaMask.**
On a laptop, it will get added as a browser extension, in the top right corner of your browser.
Click on the fox icon and get started. You can decide to provide anonymized information to MetaMask or not.

**Create your Wallet.**
Provide a secure password to secure access to your wallet. Read the T&C and agree.
Now MetaMask will generate a secret backup phrase for you. This is called a seed. A seed is a collection of random words (in MetaMask it’s 12 words) used as a unique starting point to create your accounts. Consider and treat it like a root password.

Although MetaMask provides an option to back-up your secret phrase later, it is strongly recommended that you do this immediately. This is the unique key to your wallet; if you lose it, you lose everything that is associated with it.

Feel free to [read more on public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and [how seed phrases are used to create addresses](https://medium.com/@wolovim/ethereum-201-hd-wallets-11d0c93c87f7how) (with code in Python). It’s not needed here, but it’s interesting anyway.

Confirm your secret backup phrase and finish your MetaMask wallet setup.
