Data DeFi aims to expand the usage of data within our society by addressing the question: how can data be used as a financial asset? To better understand how Ocean Protocol brings this new and exciting concept to life, let us dive into key ideas behind data and DeFi respectively.

**Datatokens: tokenized access to data and data services**

In Ocean Protocol, each dataset or data service gets its own datatoken. *Datatokens grant the right to access the data or data service*. Data access is defined by the publisher, and could be unlimited or restricted to a single day.
The purpose of a datatoken is similar to traditional access tokens (OAuth 2.0 - used in “login with Google'' for example), where a third-party is granted access to server resources on behalf of the owner without sharing credentials. With these access tokens, users can access web services and applications without giving away their password. The mental model is comparable to Ocean Protocol datatokens, where tokens are used to grant access to datasets or data services.

**DeFi: bankless finance**

Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, refers to a number of tools and applications providing financial services through smart contracts rather than intermediaries. This is why it is also called *bankless finance*. There are many types of such Decentralized Apps (dApps) currently in existence in the DeFi space, covering a wide array of services:

- Web3 wallet (i.e. bank account)
- Decentralized exchanges
- Lending and borrowing platforms
- Leveraged trading platforms
- Insurance funds
- Decentralized proof of identity (access to apps and services)

DeFi tools are sometimes referred to as “**money legos**” because they can be assembled together to create new financial products & services, or complex financial engineering systems.

**Data + DeFi: an explosive combination**
We’ve seen that (i) datatokens are a representation of data access to a dataset or data service and (ii) DeFi provides financial services on top of the blockchain. So what happens when you combine the two? You get **Data DeFi**, where data and data services become a new financial asset class.

Datatokens create a bridge between data, data services and DeFi, with which data and data services can be seamlessly integrated into all financial products and services in the DeFi space. This offers tremendous opportunities to bring advanced financial tools to data science. You can think of instant data exchanges, data insurances, crowdsourcing your data-driven project or company, or call options on data.
Since datatokens can be held, transferred, exchanged and traded with any Web3 software or device, all of these DeFi dApps mentioned earlier work with datatokens:

- Web3 wallets turn into data wallets
- Exchanges become data marketplaces
- Lending platforms can now allow datatokens to be borrowed/used as collateral
- Insurance can be provided on data and data services

- Market prices can be discovered for data and data services in real-time

This innovation creates “**data legos**”; any existing dApp can work to serve our new asset class.

All thanks to Ocean Protocol, the transfer, exchange and trade of data access rights on a decentralized and permissionless network becomes possible.
