Upon successful completion of the Ocean 101 course, participants get a certificate in PDF, shareable on social media, and they can mint it as a non-fungible token ([NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)). The certificate is a requirement to join  the Ocean Ambassadors community, a group of leading AI/Web3 experts supporting the reshaping of the Data Economy.

**But first things first, why should you care about Ocean Protocol?**
Modern society runs on data. More and more services rely on AI, and AI is only as good as the quantity and quality of data that gets in.  Companies that have both vast data and internal AI expertise, like Google and Facebook, are getting the lion’s share. In contrast, AI startups have amazing algorithms but are starving for data; and many organizations  have data, but are not turning it into value.

**Unfulfilled Data Demand**. Many people and organizations are limited by their access to quality data to support decision making, build services, or data products. And a lot of  data is needed to reach decent accuracy in data science, and particularly in AI. In addition to the amount of data, data quality can also be a challenge when looking out for data.

**Anemic Data Supply**. There are about 10 Terabytes of data for each person connected to the internet, most of which remain unused, or untouchable because data owners don’t share it. Individuals may not share their data due to risks to their privacy or they are coerced to share their data with the big tech as part of Terms & Conditions. And corporations are reluctant to share or pool data with others for fear of losing exclusivity (i.e. data theft) and losing a competitive advantage.

**Pushing the Frontier**. Ocean Protocol is already being integrated by enterprises across verticals, from packaged goods, freight and logistics, science, biotech, to the automotive industry.

**A New Data Economy with Ocean Protocol**. Ocean Protocol is set to bridge the gap between data supply and demand to make data available for data scientists so they can create breakthrough data and AI products, and grant data owners a revenue for safely letting their data flow. Better AI will better serve society as a whole.

**Don’t worry about the blockchain stuff, it’s much easier than you think!**
