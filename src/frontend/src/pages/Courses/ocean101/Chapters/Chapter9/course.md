# Chapter 9: Get Play Money
#### Difficulty: **3/5** \| Estimated reading time: **3 min**

<dialog character="squid">Excellent, you have the first piece of equipment now. If you want to do anything in the blockchain waters rather than watching from the surface, you will need to dive into it, and you will need oxygen for that. ETH provides the gas you need to stay below the surface.</dialog>

**Get play money from a faucet.**
Faucets are places where it’s possible to get tokens for free. Usually, they hand play money, basically tokens that have no market value. Many developers use faucets to start building apps in a safe and free environment before launching them on the main network.

Go to MetaMask and select Goerli Test Network in the upper central dropdown list. Your wallet address is the same as in the Ethereum Network, but everything is free to play now. You may later use the same dropdown menu to switch to the BSC or Polygon network, which Ocean Protocol is also connected to.

On Goerli, **<a href="https://faucets.chain.link/" target="_blank" > the LINK faucet on the Goerli testnet </a>** is the suggested faucet as you will get some play LINK on top of play ETH.  LINK currently requires a Twitter account to verify you are a human.  Alternatively you may use the <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" target="_blank" > official Goerli faucet </a> which currently requires you to setup an account with Alchemy.io using sign-up with Google or Email/Password.

Copy your ETH wallet address by clicking on ‘Account 1’, the default account created by Metamask. Clicking will automatically copy your wallet address to the clipboard. You can safely share this address with anyone because it is public and it does not control your funds (with your set-up only your Metamask and your seed phrase can control your funds).

**You can also view the transaction on the blockchain** if you search for your wallet address via a Blockchain explorer like <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_blank" >Etherscan</a>.

Blockchain explorers are public tools that allow anyone to search through the blockchain and check all transactions.
If you have a spare minute go there and have a look, it’s nice to see ones’ transaction make history!
