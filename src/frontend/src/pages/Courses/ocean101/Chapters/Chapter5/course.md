#### Difficulty: **3/5** \| Estimated reading time: **10 min**

<dialog character="jellyfish">Have you heard about Smart Contracts and Web3?
You don’t need to understand how they work, but having a general idea will help. You can see without a mask in the water, but things are blurry, so here is your next piece of equipment.</dialog>

**Smart Contract.**
A Smart Contract is a program that runs on a distributed computer. When people agree to use a smart contract, the program will perform the given action it was programmed to do if agreed conditions are met. This saves time, money, and limits conflicts when doing business with others.

A Smart Contract is a program that automatically performs transactions based on predetermined conditions, exactly as agreed. “If heads, you win our 5$ bet, if tails, I win”

Smart contracts are especially useful for managing data workflows across people, teams, and companies, because they run in a way that is 100% deterministic. This means that once the smart contract is deployed, it will run exactly as agreed when the conditions are triggered.

**Vending machine example.** A Smart Contract could make some data available (transaction) once a payment was received (predetermined condition), regardless of its source (accessible by anyone). Such a contract could be called a “data vending machine”.
This smart contract will always deliver access to the data if it has received a payment. It does not matter when or where the buyer is located and who that person is. You can get your data seamlessly through this contract, and that can come handy if you happen to work late at night on an analysis due in the morning. Just “pay and play”.

**Verifiability.** The agreement in the smart contract, its trigger conditions, and the operations it does are all publicly verifiable on the blockchain. In our previous example, everyone can track if and how the data was accessed and verify that the access condition(s) were met. This is made simple thanks to blockchain technology: the blockchain stores all transaction(s) related to all smart contracts, providing cryptographic proof of everything that happened.

**Web3.**
The Web3 is a mesh network of blockchains and smart contracts that interact with each other, and that form a new layer on top of the current internet. Web3 is an awesome new space because it has no central point, no owners, and no borders.

It’s called Web 3.0 because it’s an evolution of the internet since its beginning. The Web3 internet is built on fundamentally different infrastructure, utilizing blockchains and distributed peer-to-peer networks, compared to the current existing internet which relies on server-client relationships.

**Evolution of the web**. On its creation, the Web 1.0 was a network of relatively big entities like big universities offering access to static content. Service providers gave access to that content spread across hosts across the globe.

The Web 2.0 of the 00’s introduced the possibility for users to add their own content to a webpage in blog, then in social networks. Central entities monetize user data to provide ‘free’ accounts and services. This has evolved in what leading academics now describe as [surveillance capitalism](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff/1127581387).

The Web 3.0, or Web3, of the 20’s allows for full liberalization of networks, removing the need for central intermediaries. Just like TCP/IP are communication protocols that define how information is sent between clients and servers over the Web, Ocean Protocol is a protocol that defines how data assets are exchanged in Web3.

**In Web3, anyone is free to transact without limits.** Anyone can buy, sell, trade in existing markets, and create new markets. We will see in the next chapters how Ocean Protocol makes this easy for the data and analytics markets.
