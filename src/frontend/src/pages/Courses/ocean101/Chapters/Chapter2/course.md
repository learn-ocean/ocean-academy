<dialog character="jellyfish">You are now below water. This is a new environment. It feels like flying, it’s awesome. Most divers will tell you that they got hooked by the experience of moving freely in 3D from their very first dive. Same here. You will get a taste of a new universe enabled by collaborative technologies, in uncharted territories.</dialog>

Understanding what is a blockchain and a smart contract will help fully grasp the value that Ocean Protocol can provide. If you are already familiar with these concepts, you can go directly to <a href="https://oceanacademy.io/ocean101/chapter-6" target="_blank" >chapter 6</a>.

### A Blockchain

is simply a ledger that chronologically records the facts that it is programmed to record. This ledger is duplicated across participants, and public, which allows everyone to check that its entries are correct. This removes the need for a central ‘validation authority’: you don’t need to trust when you can verify.

**Blockchains work like enhanced Google sheets.** You can think of a blockchain as a Google sheet with universal read and write access, but that can only accept new inputs if those new inputs are compliant with what the sheet was programmed to accept.

- Only those with a valid input can change the document
- Old entries cannot be altered or deleted
- Everyone can see that no one provided a non-compliant input

**Bitcoin** was the first use case for blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s blockchain is used to record monetary transactions in a verifiable and trustable way. On that blockchain, you can write that you’re sending 0.01 Bitcoin to someone only if your account on record has a balance of at least 0.01 Bitcoin. This is a rule that was programmed in this blockchain.

**Ethereum** was the first ledger to allow the recording of not just transactions, but any kind of operation, making it essentially a distributed computer. This greatly extended the foundation that Bitcoin had established and propelled blockchain technology to all sorts of applications beyond just a digital currency.

The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are permissionless: anyone can operate or transact on these blockchains. Private blockchains exist, but they are limited in scope. And they wouldn’t be well suited to create an inclusive data economy: **Ocean Protocol** wants to be accessible to anyone who has data or expertise, not just a select few.
